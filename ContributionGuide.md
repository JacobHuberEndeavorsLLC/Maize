# Make a contribution

Here are some ways you can contribute:

- Work on an existing issue [here](https://github.com/cobmin/Maize/issues).

> Check out the [documentation standards](#documentation-standards) before you start working on a pull request.

# Claim a Maize Contributor NFT

A Maize Contributor NFT is rewarded to anyone that merges in a pull request the Maize GitHub repository.

After your pull request is merged, I will reach out to you to get you your NFT. You only receive a Maize Contributor NFT for the first pull request you merge in a given year.

# Documentation standards

Use the [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/) as a base point of reference for writing style.

### Philosophy

- Create the minimum viable documentation.
- Don't repeat yourself, use links to existing documentation or inherit it.
- Keep documentation close to what it's describing (for example, in the source code).

### Document types

Group documentation under one of the four categories (adopted from [Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/)):

- Concepts
- Guides
- Reference
- Resources

### Creating content

If you are interested in creating content (video, blog post, tweet thread, visuals, etc.), you are absolutely free to do so. If review is needed on these, please reach out to me on the [Maize Discord](https://discord.gg/gKxvUjRpvw).
