Maize is the successor to LoopDropSharp, https://github.com/cobmin/LoopDropSharp. 

If you have used LDS then you will love Maize. It has all the same functionality and more. Improved error handling, faster performance, intuitive interface, and yes, all data is logged to a csv file to use in notepad or excel.
